The player checks 1000 potential shuffled moves to 1 depth. Scores moves
based on her score minus the opponent's score. Wins against dumb player nearly
every single time (once lost on a 12 d game randomly. Suspect it is because of
the sampling of 1000 random moves from the potential list). When playing
itself, our players seem to score relatively easily regardless of pairs.
