matchup.py
==========
matchup.py allows you to see the matchups between
two different players. it produces output that looks like this:

$ ./matchup.py group6 dumb 7
              dumb
                  +1    +3    +5
 group6     +1        -146  -440
            +3  -440        -308
            +5  -440  -102      

How to run it
-------------
You run it like this:
./matchup.py <player1> <player2> <d>
which will run a matchup between player1 and player2 for
all possible p-q pairs with d.

How to read it
--------------
The output above shows us that player 'dumb' lost all of the matches
she played. Her closest match was when she lost by only 102, when
her opponent had a p-q difference of 5 (p=1, q=6) and she had a p-q
difference of 3 (p=2, q=5).

Matches where the difference in score was > 150 are bolded, so it's extra apparent.
